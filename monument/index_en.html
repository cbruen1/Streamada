      <p class="description">The Spanish Armada was a fleet of 130 ships that sailed from A Coruna in August 1588 under the command of the Duke of Medina Sidonia with the purpose of escorting an army from Flanders to invade England. It met with armed resistance in the English Channel, when a fireship attack off Calais broke its formation, and was driven into the North Sea after the Battle of Gravelines.</p>
      <p class="description">In their efforts to escape, the Spanish Armada ships sailed up the North Sea, around the top of Scotland and intended to sail down the west coast of Ireland, then back to Spain. Three of these ships were wrecked off Streedagh, though there is some uncertainty regarding the identity of one of these ships, the positively identified wrecks at Streedagh are those of the La Lavia and the Santa Maria, the third wreck was for many years thought to be that of the La Julianna, though information now reveals that this particular ship was probably wrecked near Glenagivney in County Donegal, and that the third ship wrecked at Streedagh was possibly called the San Pedro. </p>

      <h2>about</h2>
      <p>Ever since the tragic loss of three great ships of the Spanish Armada and over 1,100 men; soldiers and sailors, noblemen and commoners; on the beach at Streedagh on that fateful day, 21st September 1588, the people of North Sligo have commemorated in folk memory the plight of all those poor lost fellow souls.
        Despite the risk of persecution from the forces of Queen Elizabeth the first of England some Irish chieftains like O’Rourke of Briefne and McClancy of Dartry offered sanctuary to the few survivors that struggled ashore. The real heroes were, perhaps, the ordinary peasant people who, for no other reason than empathy for those in distress, gave shelter, food, and succour to strangers from a foreign land.
        The people of Streedagh, Grange and North Sligo have, over the years, marked the story of this maritime disaster on our shoreline in many ways. The 400th Anniversary in 1988 saw the launch of the booklet still in use today “The Spanish Armada 1588- The Journey of Francisco De Cuellar- Sligo to the Causeway Coast”
        Grange and Armada Development Association organised a very successful series of events throughout that year including Music and Dance events, a pop up Museum, A Symposium, visits by Spanish Dignitaries and interests, Walks etc. Of particular importance was the development of The De Cuellar Trail through the North West to the Causeway Coast.        
      </p>
      <p>The re-constituted Grange and Armada Development Association along with the Celtic Fringe Festival have ambitious plans to develop a tourist offering based on the Armada and De Cuellar stories. We hope to enlist Spanish Associations and Interests in furthering these plans.</p>
